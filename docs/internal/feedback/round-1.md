## Categorized Feedback

### P1 - High Pain (Address First)

| ID | Feedback | Type | Phase | Pain | Effort | Source |
|----|----------|------|-------|------|--------|--------|
| [F1] | Plan takes too long to run (User Sn corroborated but values devil's advocate rigor) | `performance` | `phase:plan` | High | Medium | User TJ, User Sn |
| [F2] | Time could be improved in every iteration | `performance` | `phase:cross-cutting` | High | High | User TJ |
| [F3] | Brownfield file structure/logic understanding - AI plugins should understand existing codebase structure; this info isn't present in Claude as agents typically handle this | `feature-request` | `phase:cross-cutting` | High | High | User TJ |

### P2 - Medium Priority

| ID | Feedback | Type | Phase | Pain | Effort | Source |
|----|----------|------|-------|------|--------|--------|
| [F4] | Branch name random/inconsistent | `bug` | `phase:cross-cutting` | Medium | Low | User TJ |
| [F5] | Constitution not up to scratch (quality issues) | `enhancement` | `phase:setup` | Medium | Medium | User TJ |
| [F6] | Picks up random response times and numbers in output | `bug` | `phase:cross-cutting` | Medium | Low | User TJ |
| [F7] | Retrospective view of earlier phases - feedback in planning phase should reflect back in spec phase | `feature-request` | `phase:cross-cutting` | Medium | Medium | User TJ |
| [F8] | Human feedback should be taken before devil's advocate to reduce cycle time and iterations | `enhancement` | `phase:specify` | Medium | Low | User TJ |
| [F9] | Devil's advocate should research and critique both human feedback and other agent personalities, not just specs | `enhancement` | `phase:specify` | Medium | Medium | User TJ |
| [F10] | Function-level modularity needed, not file-level - initial simplicity led to multiple files but granularity is wrong | `enhancement` | `phase:tasks` | Medium | Medium | User TJ |
| [F11] | PR too long | `enhancement` | `phase:implement` | Medium | Medium | User Le |
| [F16] | Non-technical users may clone repo instead of plugin install, polluting branch with humaninloop codebase | `bug` | `phase:cross-cutting` | Medium | Medium | User Dh (observing Sn) |
| [F17] | Shell script security concerns: (a) eval with untrusted get_feature_paths output risks arbitrary code execution, (b) source.sh replacement attack vector, (c) no input sanitization, (d) unsafe ls for directory checks | `bug` | `phase:cross-cutting` | Medium | Medium | User Le |

### P3 - Backlog

| ID | Feedback | Type | Phase | Pain | Effort | Source |
|----|----------|------|-------|------|--------|--------|
| [F12] | Web search surface area restriction - enterprise feature, good to have | `feature-request` | `phase:cross-cutting` | Low | High | User TJ |
| [F13] | Gold standard pydantic can be in inner layer of hex architecture | `enhancement` | `phase:cross-cutting` | Low | Medium | User TJ |
| [F14] | Code generated by task list not necessarily required - implement phase handles actual code | `enhancement` | `phase:tasks` | Low | Low | User TJ |
| [F15] | Simple questioner initially asking user preferences for type of design and principles to follow | `feature-request` | `phase:setup` | Low | Medium | User TJ |

## Quick Wins

Low-effort items to tackle first for momentum:

1. **Branch name random** ([F4]) - Likely a simple fix in branch naming logic
2. **Random response times/numbers** ([F6]) - Likely a template or prompt adjustment
3. **Human feedback before devil's advocate** ([F8]) - Workflow reordering, minimal code change

## Post-Round Notes

- Performance is a recurring theme (3 items: [F1], [F2], [F3] relate to speed/efficiency)
- Workflow ordering suggestions ([F7], [F8]) indicate users want more control over the process
- User TJ provided comprehensive feedback across all phases
- User Le's feedback ([F11] PR too long) aligns with general verbosity concerns
- **User diversity**: Feedback spans software engineers (TJ, Le) and non-technical users (Sn)
- **Positive signal**: User Sn found planning slow but valued the devil's advocate rigor - suggests the thoroughness is appreciated even when it takes time
- **Installation UX gap**: Non-technical users may struggle with plugin installation vs repo cloning ([F16])
