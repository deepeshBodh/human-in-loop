## Categorized Feedback

### P1 - High Pain (Address First)

| # | Feedback | Type | Phase | Pain | Effort | Source |
|---|----------|------|-------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Plan takes too long to run | `performance` | `phase:plan` | High | Medium | User TJ |
| 2 | Time could be improved in every iteration | `performance` | `phase:cross-cutting` | High | High | User TJ |
| 3 | Brownfield file structure/logic understanding - AI plugins should understand existing codebase structure; this info isn't present in Claude as agents typically handle this | `feature-request` | `phase:cross-cutting` | High | High | User TJ |

### P2 - Medium Priority

| # | Feedback | Type | Phase | Pain | Effort | Source |
|---|----------|------|-------|------|--------|--------|
| 4 | Branch name random/inconsistent | `bug` | `phase:cross-cutting` | Medium | Low | User TJ |
| 5 | Constitution not up to scratch (quality issues) | `enhancement` | `phase:setup` | Medium | Medium | User TJ |
| 6 | Picks up random response times and numbers in output | `bug` | `phase:cross-cutting` | Medium | Low | User TJ |
| 7 | Retrospective view of earlier phases - feedback in planning phase should reflect back in spec phase | `feature-request` | `phase:cross-cutting` | Medium | Medium | User TJ |
| 8 | Human feedback should be taken before devil's advocate to reduce cycle time and iterations | `enhancement` | `phase:specify` | Medium | Low | User TJ |
| 9 | Devil's advocate should research and critique both human feedback and other agent personalities, not just specs | `enhancement` | `phase:specify` | Medium | Medium | User TJ |
| 10 | Function-level modularity needed, not file-level - initial simplicity led to multiple files but granularity is wrong | `enhancement` | `phase:tasks` | Medium | Medium | User TJ |
| 11 | PR too long | `enhancement` | `phase:implement` | Medium | Medium | User Le |

### P3 - Backlog

| # | Feedback | Type | Phase | Pain | Effort | Source |
|---|----------|------|-------|------|--------|--------|
| 12 | Web search surface area restriction - enterprise feature, good to have | `feature-request` | `phase:cross-cutting` | Low | High | User TJ |
| 13 | Gold standard pydantic can be in inner layer of hex architecture | `enhancement` | `phase:cross-cutting` | Low | Medium | User TJ |
| 14 | Code generated by task list not necessarily required - implement phase handles actual code | `enhancement` | `phase:tasks` | Low | Low | User TJ |
| 15 | Simple questioner initially asking user preferences for type of design and principles to follow | `feature-request` | `phase:setup` | Low | Medium | User TJ |

## Quick Wins

Low-effort items to tackle first for momentum:

1. **Branch name random** (#4) - Likely a simple fix in branch naming logic
2. **Random response times/numbers** (#6) - Likely a template or prompt adjustment
3. **Human feedback before devil's advocate** (#8) - Workflow reordering, minimal code change

## Post-Round Notes

- Performance is a recurring theme (3 items: #1, #2, #3 relate to speed/efficiency)
- Workflow ordering suggestions (#7, #8) indicate users want more control over the process
- User TJ provided comprehensive feedback across all phases
- User Le's feedback (#11 PR too long) aligns with general verbosity concerns
